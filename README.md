congestion during rush hours.

This is the current draft of requirements:

- Fees will differ between 9 SEK and 22 SEK, depending on the time of day.
- The maximum fee for one day is 60 SEK.
- Only the highest fee should be charged for multiple passages within a 60
  minute period.
- Some vehicle types are fee-free.
- Fee-free days are; Saturdays, Sundays, holidays and day before holidays and
  the whole month of July. See [Transportstyrelsen][] for details.

## Your assignment

The last city-developer quit recently, claiming that this solution is
production-ready. You are now the new developer for our city - congratulations!

name on.

## Instructions

### Feeling for front end?!
> ℹ️ *Optional*

The mentioned that they had been working on an awesome UI where the *city traffic control manager*
easily could add passages manually and calculate costs. We thought that was great, until we tried it out... This was
promised to be production ready, but we feel something is fishy as the *manager* got furious using it!

- Fix the application 🛠️
- Allow adding multiple passages 🚗 🏎️ 🏍️
- Show total cost 💰
- Tidy up the UI ✨

### Build beautiful back end?!
> ℹ️ *Optional*

The developer also mentioned that they had been working on an awesome API where the *city traffic control UX department*
easily could check for costs for passages. They got excited, until they tried it out... This was
also promised to be production ready, but we feel something is odd as the *UX people* got mad calling the endpoints!

- Fix the API 👷‍👷
- Allow checking costs for passages using your awesome logic! 📈
