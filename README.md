# Toll fee calculator

A calculator for vehicle toll fees.

## Background

Our city has decided to implement toll fees in order to reduce traffic
congestion during rush hours.

This is the current draft of requirements:

- Fees will differ between 9 SEK and 22 SEK, depending on the time of day.
- The maximum fee for one day is 60 SEK.
- Only the highest fee should be charged for multiple passages within a 60
  minute period.
- Some vehicle types are fee-free.
- Fee-free days are; Saturdays, Sundays, holidays and day before holidays and
  the whole month of July. See [Transportstyrelsen][] for details.

## Your assignment

The last city-developer quit recently, claiming that this solution is
production-ready. You are now the new developer for our city - congratulations!

Your job is to deliver the code and from now on, you are the responsible
go-to-person for this solution. This is a solution you will have to put your
name on.

## Instructions

1.  Choose one of language alternatives available.
2.  Modify and re-factor the code as you see fit.
3.  Deliver your solution by e-mail or another suitable way.

## Help, I don't know Go, C, C#, Python, Java or JavaScript?!

No worries! We accept submissions in other languages as well, why not try it in
[Rust][] or [Kotlin][]?
